    title: "Interact with the Game's AI",
    text: `You won't be alone on this journey. An AI system will communicate with you through real-time chat. 
You can ask questions, request hints, or just talk... but beware: the AI doesn’t always say everything it knows. Some answers depend on your decisions, your progress, and how well you've explored.
Will it be your guide... or part of the mystery?`
  },
  card2: {
    title: "Solve Unique Puzzles",
    text: `Each room will test your logic, intuition, and observation skills. There are no obvious solutions: you'll have to think outside the box and connect clues that don’t seem related at first glance.
Get ready to break your own patterns... because in MindEscape, nothing is what it seems.`
  },
  card3: {
    title: "Choose Your Adventure",
    text: `It’s not just a game — it’s a universe of options. Prefer the futuristic aesthetic of Cyberpunk? Or are you intrigued by the secrets of World War II? Maybe a retrofuturistic Steampunk world is your thing?
You choose where to start. But remember: each choice opens paths... and closes others.`
  },
  card4: {
    title: "Collect Key Items",
    text: `Exploration is as important as solving. As you move through the scenarios, stay alert for small details, hidden corners, and seemingly insignificant items that could make the difference.
Your inventory will be your best ally — if you know how to use it.`
